# heroku-server-render

A Leiningen template for creating web applications intended to be hosted on
Heroku using Postgres for storage.

The Clojure community tends to prefer libraries to frameworks. This can result
in some spin up time for new apps as you piece together your choice of
libraries. `heroku-server-render` aims to give you a running start.

It includes:

* [Bidi][bidi] for request routing.
* [Hiccup][hiccup] for server side html templating.
* [Friend][friend] for authentication and authorisation.
* [Korma][korma] for database queries.
* [clj-sql-up][cljsqlup] for database migrations.
* [Http-kit][httpkit] for serving web.

Environment variables are used for configuration. We recomment using
[foreman][foreman] for managing environments. A `.env` file is created in the
root of your project for this purpose.

## Usage

Create your project.

```sh
lein new heroku-server-render your-project
```

Then for development first set up the database.

```sh
foreman run ./scripts/db/start
foreman run ./scripts/db/create
foreman run ./scripts/db/migrations/run
```

Then start a repl and connect from your editor.

```sh
foreman run ./scripts/repl
```

There's a comment in `core.clj` that you can execute to get a dev server
running.

```clojure
(in-ns 'your-project.core)
(server)
(def server (-main "8080"))
```

Run it again to restart the server after making changes.
